              I have experience, I've held executive positions in many clubs, and have been part of my schools student
              council for 2 years.
              I know how to get things done. I will be available to contact 24/7, through my <a href="https://www.instagram.com/umar_dcti/">instagram,</a>, or shoot me an
              email at <a href="https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/?view=cm&fs=1&to=syed.umar@student.tdsb.on.ca&tf=1">syed.umar@student.tdsb.on.ca.</a>
              Ultimately my goal is to make sure your ideas are brought to the attention of the Student Senate. I’d
              really like to make the Student Senate work for the students it represents, so feel free to send me any
              ideas or suggestions you may have, and remember, Vote Umar!

      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-6" id="cp-fade-1">No one individual is able to accomplish what many could do together, I’d like to mention what
          I’ve done as part of the student council couldn't have been done without everyone on the council who worked
          tirelessly to make incredible events possible.
        </div>
        <div class="col-6" id="cp-fade-2">As part of the student council, we managed to make one of our major school dances affordable
          to many more students, so much so that we sold out! Events like these begin to demonstrate the work I will be
          able to do as President of the Student Senate.</div>

      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-6" id="cp-fade-3">
          I’ve also founded and been the executive of many different clubs, this has given me the
          skills necessary to effectively delegate work, and manage time, which will be crucial as the President of the
          Student Senate. For example, starting the virtual chess club this year, I’ve organized an executive team which
          helps coordinate every chess meet, and allows our players to improve their game. These skills will allow me to
          create a Student Senate that is effective, I just need your vote, so Vote Umar!</div>
        <div class="col-6" id="cp-fade-4">
          Even during the pandemic and our quadmester system, I’ve helped to organize and run events
          virtually or with the limited physical access we have had, and try and normalize the school year. Despite the
          constrictions of this year, the events organized have been successful and engaging, and I believe I can bring
          that to the Student Senate.
